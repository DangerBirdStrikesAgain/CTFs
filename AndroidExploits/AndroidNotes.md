Android Studio is used to emulate the android apps! 

I would suggest aliasing it in .bashrc (hmmm, talk about this elsewhere) so that you can run it from anywhere! 
alias android='{installation home}/bin/studio.sh'
Where {installation home} is where android studio is located. 

Look, android studio hates you and you hate it. 

Work out how to make it run faster I think it's KVM. 
And perhaps roll the android emulator you're using back a couple.
